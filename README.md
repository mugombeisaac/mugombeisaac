### RENU IT PROGRAMME 2023
**mugombeisaac/mugombeisaac** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
 I’m currently working  at RENU(Research and Education Network for Uganda)
# Week 1 (26th - 30th)
| MON | TUE | WED | THUR | FRI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orientation.We were oriented about RENU by the CEO Mr.Nicholas Mbonimpa whereby he took us through the RENU history,RENU ecosystem and RENU operations. | My collegues and I were introduced to Cisco Certified Network Associate Study guide.I went through the different chapters in this guide | It was a public holiday | Installation of Oracle virtual Box,Docker and VM ware on my laptop. | installation of the containers of ubuntu and debian inside the docker and also generated SSH keys | 
# Week 2 (3rd - 7th)
| MON | TUE | WED | THUR | FRI |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| I  learnt different kinds of operating systems ie windows, linux and the BSD and got an introduction on version control. | I acquired knowledge about virtualisation and containerisation going into deep to understand the difference between virtual machines and containers. I also went into the practical session whereby i installed linux-ubuntu on the server virtually | i was able to log into the server remotely using SSH keys | I was successful with installing windows on the virtual machine and adding an active directory. | I installed docker on my linux ubuntu virtual machine and I also installed pihole on the docker installed  
# Week 3 (10th - 14th)

| My group and I agreed on the techique to use in the pen test as this is  "Penetration Testing Execution Standard(PTES) V1.0. Seven main sections are defined as the basis for the execution of Pentration Testing which include Pre-engagement, Interactions, intelligence gathering, threat modeling, vulnetrability Analysis, exploitation, post exploitation and reporting. Further more we also had a discussion on the diferent layers of the OSI model whereby I saw the services at each layer and the devices that belong to each layer respectively | I learnt about layer2 switching which operates at the data link layer(layer2) of the OSI model.  I also learnt that layer2 switching involves the use of switches to forward data packets between network devices based on their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. I also looked their limitations of layer2 switches one of which was the "broadcast storm"  and also looked at some bit of the spanning tree protocol | I was introdued to VLANs( Virtual Local Area Networks) whereby this is the technology used logically segment a single physical network into multiple virtual networks. some of their advantages include; enhanced security, improved performance,simplified network management, flexibility and scalability. I also covered static and dynamic vlans whereby i saw that static vlans are interface based while dynamic vlans are MAC based.I looked at some tagging types namely the IEEE 802.1q and it came to my concern that a trunk carries multiple vlans while access points tag and untag frames. I dealt also with intervlan routing whereby I looked at the traditional,the use of router on stick and the use of layer3 switch in intervlan routing. | I was taken through the TCP/IP model which is actually a condensed version of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model.The TCP/IP model is composed of four layers ie process/application layer, Host-to Host layer, internet and the network acces layers. I also leanrt IP addressing whereby I got to know more about the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. On the other note were the the private and public IPs, subdivided the IPv6 addresses into the unicast(one to one),multicast(one to many) and anycast (connect to the nearest host) addresses. I saw that unicast is further subdivided into the unique local addresses, link local addresses,special addresses and global unicast addresses. | i have dealt more with some research of the project |

# Week 4 (17th - 21st)
| MON | TUE | WED | THUR | FRI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|- Routing ie static routes, default routes and dynamic routes.- looked at Interior gateway protocols ie OSPF and IS-IS.- Installed GNS3 on my machine | Basic router and switch commands in packet tracer. Covered external Gateway protocols ie BGP(iBGP and eBGP) and implemented network design in GNS3 using OSPF | a visit to RENU Data Centre(DC),Kampala-2 POP at MU-JHU | Disassembled and assembled a dell E6440 laptop observing different hardware components in it. Wireless concepts | Presenting OSPF assignment done using GSN3.- RENU end of quarter 11 staff meeting and had a career talk from the UCC Executive Director Eng.Irene Kaggwa. |
# Week 5 (24th - 28th)
| MON | TUE | WED | THUR | FRI |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| looked at linux shell and navigation of the linux file system | The different text editors in linux ie vim,Vi and nano | file permissions and manipulation of data with a filter,tools and redirection techniques| use of ansible to create a directory and automatically create a file where i was able to create 100 files in that directory | Interacted with the sed command and attented an awareness meeting with the Group Personal Accident.| 
# Week 6
| MON | TUE | WED | THUR | FRI|
|--- | --- | ----| --- | ---|
|I looked at the network monitoring tools ie Nagios, Cacti and LibreNMS | I looked at the email etiquette and ticketing. | I  looked at the various tools for static analysis ie NfSen and elastiflow.| Configured a point to point link | Research work whereby i researched more about Nagios |
# Week 7
I looked at systems bit of DNS whereby i looked at the DNS hierarchy and also went further to set it up thus looking at the zones file and the A and NS(name server) record. I also looked at the management commands ie man ps, systemctl status bind9, systemctl daemon-reload.:
